# AHK-Vi-ArrowKeys
An AutoHotkey script that works like Karabiner for Mac's old VI mode. Press S+D, and use the right hand home row to emulate arrow keys.

Note that because "ds" is present in many English words (ex: cards, words, etc.), but "sd" is present in nearly none, the S key must be pressed slightly before the D key.

## List of Remappings
While S+D pressed (S pressed before D):
* H -> Left Arrow
* J -> Down Arrow
* K -> Up Arrow
* L -> Right Arrow
